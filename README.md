# Hi there!
This is my first GitHub repo. I decided to publish one of my projects so that other people could use it and give me feedback. This is a simple web browser based on the flutter_inappwebview component (currently compiled only for Android). It has localization and fully local data storage.
If you liked my project, fork it and make changes, some of which will definitely make it into new releases.
# Good luck :)
